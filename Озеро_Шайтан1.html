<H1 align="center">Lake Shaitan in the Kirov region</H1>
<P>Lake Shaitan is perhaps the main natural attraction of the Urzhumsky district of the Kirov region. Its uniqueness attracts a lot of tourists to these places. In order to preserve the natural state of the reservoir, the Bushkovsky Forest Nature Reserve was created in July 2007.<BR>
The lake can not boast of a large size. Its area, or, in scientific terms, the size of the water mirror is only about 2 hectares. In 1939, it reached 3 hectares, but every year it gradually decreases. So, in 1974, the area was already 2.9 hectares. The changes also affect the depth of the reservoir. Currently, the distance between the surface and the bottom is a maximum of 12 meters (according to some unconfirmed reports-25 meters). Documented depth in 1939 showed a mark of 14 meters.<BR>
In 1972, the water surface was covered with 27 islands (their area varied from 0.8 to 15 m), in the 90s there were already about 52 of them. However, it is not always possible to notice such formations on the water surface — most of the islands are washed ashore. The reason for their appearance is the formation of so-called splavin (overgrowth of the reservoir). When the water level rises, the wetlands break away from the shore and become floating islands.</P>

<H2>Where is located Lake Shaitan in the Kirov region</H2>
<P>The reservoir is located 39 kilometers from the city of Urzhum. Not far from it is the border with the Republic of Mari El. If you look at the map of the Kirov region, you can see the correct oval shape of the reservoir — its dimensions are 0.24 by 0.18 kilometers.</P>
<H2>Interesting facts</H2>
<P>The ejection of water actually happens in the lake. This spectacular phenomenon can most often be observed after prolonged rains or during intense snowmelt in the spring. The jet of water while gushing can reach 10 meters, although usually its height is several meters. The ejection is accompanied by a hum and echoes in the forest area.</P>
<P>Another variant is possible — a water column with a diameter of 1-1. 5 meters and a height of 1-4 meters is formed. No one has ever managed to fix the gushing on the camera - everything happens too quickly. There is nothing mystical about this phenomenon — the settling peat forms plugs in karst wells (the lake has a karst origin), and underground water pushes them to the surface.</P>

<LI>The siphon circulation and drifting islands make Lake Shaitan in the Kirov region the only one of its kind located on the Russian Plain.</LI>
<LI>One of the features of the reservoir is the late freezing and late melting of its water. In May, the remains of ice blocks float on it.</LI>
<LI>In cloudy weather, its waters really look gloomy, and in sunny weather-they reflect the blue sky and the banks bordered by green forest. You need to swim carefully here — the viscous bottom and ejections can cause a lot of trouble.</LI>
<LI>It is believed that the reservoir was formed as a result of the fall of a meteorite. Supporters of the hypothesis justify this by the fact that the glade in the northern part of the reservoir is a hillock. Its size coincides with the size of the lake, which allows us to make such conclusions. In any case, according to scientists, the age of the natural attraction is at least 1500 years.</LI>
<LI>Previously, the landowner Mosolov lived in the surroundings of the lake. To prevent his serfs from cutting down the forest without permission, he began to punish them by bathing in the lake. Since then, the felling of trees has completely stopped.</LI>
