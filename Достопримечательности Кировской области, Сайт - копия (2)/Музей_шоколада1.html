<H1 align="center">The Museum of Chocolate, Kirov</H1>
<P> In September 2014, the Museum of Chocolate in Kirov was opened. The exact name of the museum is " The Museum of the History of Chocolate Criollo ". By the way, for now this is the first and the only private museum in Kirov. Thanks to the efforts of Ksenia Larina, the daughter of Valery Krepostnov, local residents will be able to get into a sweet journey – the Museum of Chocolate. Kirov is famous not only for its museum, but also for its manors: the museum-estate of Khokhryakov and Vasnetsov.The Kirov Chocolate Museum is located next to the Local History Museum and the theater at 15 Spasskaya Street, which allows you to visit several interesting places at once in a short time within one day. The Kirov Chocolate Museum covers the entire history of chocolate from the Mayan Indians to our time, and its history, almost, has more than 3,000 years.</p>
<H2 align="center">The origin of the name “Criollo”</H2>
<P>The Kirov Chocolate Museum "Criollo" was named after the "noble" variety of cocoa beans "Criollo". Translated from Spanish, it means "aborigine". There are two main varieties of cocoa – criollo and forastero (translated as "alien"). Criollo is not called "noble" for nothing — it has a red and soft type and does not need additional fermentation (drying and preparation for long storage).</P>

<H2 align="center">The features</H2>
<P>On the territory of the Kirov Museum, you will find not only an exposition with its chocolate participants, but also a confectionery workshop, which, according to the administration, is only an addition to the museum. Making a treat is a very exciting process, but I must admit that we prefer the end result more and are happy to eat it up on both cheeks. Now interactive museums are very popular, places where you can not only see and photograph the exhibits, but also participate in various competitions, master classes, make something with your own hands and take a souvenir with you.<BR>
The Kirov Chocolate Museum corresponds to the spirit of the time – in addition to photos and tasting of the museum's treats, you can prepare a chocolate figurine yourself and take it as a souvenir. However, it will not be a souvenir for long, because the souvenir made there is really very tasty and it is unlikely to be able to put it on the shelf. Most likely, you will come back here for this "chocolate souvenir" more than once.</P>

<P>Guides at the Kirov Chocolate Museum will tell you amazing stories about the customs of the ancient Mayan and Aztec peoples. By the way, it is the Aztecs who are the authors of the original name of chocolate - "chocoatl". At that time, chocolate was a rare product, and therefore valued more than gold. For cocoa beans, the Aztecs bought slaves and could exchange them for any commodity, and chocolate itself was considered as a drink of the gods.<BR>
You will learn what path chocolate went to get to Russia, in what form and where it was sold at first, who was the initiator of the development of the culture of chocolate production and why pre-revolutionary Russian chocolate was popular all over the world. The museum is located in Kirov and, of course, we will not ignore the Vyatka "chocolatiers" - Stanislav Osipovich, who created the first confectionery factory in Kirov. Next, you will visit the "Chocolate Rooms" with huge chocolate sculptures. The weight of each of them is 50-80</P>

You can participate in standard (20 min.) or extended master classes (40 min.). The standard one includes the production of a figure (7 cm) made of chocolate, and the extended one – a figure of 15 cm.<BR>
For couples who want to spend a romantic evening in the museum, the administration of the museum offers a special design, the production of 2 chocolate figures with tea and champagne. The event can be booked for any day after 20: 00, except Monday.<BR>
The museum offers guided tours for different ages: for children from 6 to 10 years old, from 10 years old, for schoolchildren and adults. The duration of the tour is 90 minutes. For an hour and a half, you will take part in master classes on the preparation of this treat, taste different varieties of cocoa and chocolate, take a trip to the history of the delicacy, accompanied by professional museum guides. A similar museum is located in Spain – the Museum of Chocolate in Barcelona. If you are going to visit Spain, then you just have to visit this museum.
