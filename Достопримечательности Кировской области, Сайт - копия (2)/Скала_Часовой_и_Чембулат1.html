<H1 align="center">The Chembulat and Chasovoy rocks on the Nemde River, Sovetsky district of the Kirov region</H1>
<P> <B> The Chasovoy and Chembulat rocks are part of the Kamen Rock Massif on the Nemda River, but this is such a unique natural phenomenon for our places that I want to tell you more about it.</B></P>
<UL type="circle">
<LI>First of all, from here you can see just an amazingly beautiful view of the valley of the Nemda River.</LI>	
<LI>Secondly, climbers will find here an opportunity to practice their favorite hobby.</LI>
<LI>Third, there is a symbol of the Vyatka land - the famous eight-meter rock outcrop "Chasovoy" - this is a wind-and water-turned outcrop of a boulder that once broke off from a limestone massif. This is the result of an exceptionally rare form of surface karst. The Chasovoy, as if on guard, stands at the place where the rocks end, and "sees off" all those who came here by water. The Chasovoy Rock is a unique creation of nature in the valley of the Nemda River. The karst outcrop really seems to protect the beauty of these places, other wonderful corners of the Vyatka region. We can only follow his wise fortitude.<BR>
<LI>Fourth, there is a symbol of the Mari region - the rock Chembulat, on the rock you can guess a stern male face (you can see the eyes, nose, chin). By the will of fate, he turns his gaze to the south, where actually a kilometer away (behind Nemda) are the mountain and the Mari molishche Chembulat, and in fact, the rock Chembulat looks at the entire Mari territory, which is located to the south of the Kirov region.</LI>

<P>It is possible to tell about Chembulat for a long time - it is a national hero, the Mari prince and the intercessor of the people before the gods. The Mari ethnic consciousness highlights that the souls of the dead, who sacrificed themselves during their lifetime and showed bravery in the struggle for the freedom of their people, should be immortalized in the minds of people and in the history of the people. On the basis of this, there was a popular belief in saints or "earthly deities" and a nationwide cult of sacrifice in their honor.<BR>
In the world religions, the "prophets" and "saints" appeared on the basis of such veneration of great teachers, military leaders, and princes. For example, Russian people have a widespread cult of veneration for the legendary Saint Alexander Nevsky - a warrior, prince, monarch, commander, guardian of the Russian land, a saint who intercedes for Russia in difficult times. According to this similarity in the Mari religion, there are such special people who received universal respect, they became national or local deities.<BR>
So Chembulat became a universal Mari deity-Nemda Kuryk Kugyz (the Owner of the mountain on the Nemda River). At the end of his earthly life, according to legend, he entered this rock with an army, and is still hidden in it. And the Chasovoy Rock is a symbol of the Chembulat squad, which is ready to faithfully serve its prince at any time.<BR>
Unfortunately, the monument is located near an active quarry, where explosive work is periodically carried out, which may eventually lead to the destruction of a valuable historical monument.</P>
