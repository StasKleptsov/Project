<H1 align="center">The Vyatka Paleontological Museum</H1>
<P> In the heart of Kirov there is the Vyatka Paleontological Museum, which occupies one of the most beautiful city buildings, built not so long ago. Visitors to the Vyatka Museum will take a fascinating tour, as if returning them to the past, to the world of ancient lizards and dinosaurs that lived on the planet more than 260 million years ago.</P>
<p>In the Kirov region, near the town of Kotelnich, since 1933, research works have been periodically carried out. During the excavations, the remains of pareiasaurs and a number of other prehistoric reptiles were found. These findings had a great weight in the scientific world and were a rather good reason for the creation of the museum. Many of the exhibits that the Vyatka Paleontological Museum has are of great scientific value and have no equal in the world. Every year, the staff of the museum conducts scientific research on the territory of the Kotelnichsky location of pareiasaurs, which has the status of a state natural monument. The collection of fossil lizards takes place here, their cameral processing, and also further scientific interpretation and placement in the exposition.</p>
<H2 align="center">The exposition of the Museum</H2>
<P>The first hall of the Vyatka Paleontological Museum is given over to an exposition dedicated to the history of the development of life on the planet. Here, various prehistoric events are presented in a fascinating and exciting way. The central figure of the hall is a unique exhibit that was found by Soviet-Mongolian scientists in the heart of the Gobi Desert. This completely intact skeleton, 6 meters long, belongs to the predatory dinosaur Tarbosaurus, which lived 74 million years ago.</P>

<P> No less impressive is the tyrannosaurus rex, whose reconstructed head is in the museum’s exposition. A variety of archaeological finds – dinosaurs, flying lizards that lived during the Mesozoic period, help to create in the exhibition an amazing illusion of immersion in those old times when the native planet had a completely different appearance.</P>

<P>In the second hall of the museum, visitors can see the fauna of the Kotelnichsky location of pareiasaurs. New evidence of the diverse wildlife that existed on the wetlands of the Permian period have been in this unique natural object for many decades. The majestic landscapes of the ancient delta serve as a background for the exposition in this hall. The pictures of ancient history, which preceded the era of the appearance of dinosaurs, unfold before the eyes of visitors. Giant calamite horsetails and tree-like ferns hid in their thickets countless herds of pareiasaurs, therocephalians, gorgonops and other unusual reptiles, the skeletons of which were found on the territory of the modern Kirov region, near the city of Kotelnich.</P>

<H2 align="center">New Exhibits</H2>
<P>Not so long ago, the Vyatka Paleontological Museum added a new exhibit to its exposition. Visitors to the museum will now be able to view a sculptural reconstruction that represents a nest of protoceratops dinosaurs that lived more than 75 million years ago on the lands where China and Mongolia are now located. It is well known that the reproduction of dinosaurs happened in the same way as it happens now with modern reptiles, by laying eggs. During excavations in the Gobi Desert, paleontologists often found the remains of dinosaur eggshells, and sometimes even surviving clutches, which, of course, eventually turned into fossils. But in some cases, scientists were able to clear and extract from the eggs the tiny skeletons of unborn dinosaurs.</P>
