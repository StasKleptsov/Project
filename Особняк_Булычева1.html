<H1 align="center">The mansion of the merchant T. F. Bulychev in Kirov</H1>
<P>  The mansion of the merchant Bulychev in Kirov does not look like a merchant's house, or even a simple living house. Most likely, it resembles a palace from an eastern fairy tale, evoking thoughts of the Alambre and the Moors. This impression cannot be dispelled even by the fact that today the regional department of the FSB is located in the mansion. Only the huge double-headed eagles in the crowns of the Russian Empire, sitting on the towers at the corners of the central facade, seem to hint at what country this amazing castle is located in.<BR>
The architect of the mansion was the famous I. Charushin, to whom Vyatka owes a lot. The customer was a wealthy merchant who wanted to please in this way his daughter, spoiled by St. Petersburg luxury. To lure her back to her hometown, the merchant Bulychev was ready to spend (and spent) a lot of money both on the exterior of the building and on its "stuffing". For that time, it was a super-high-tech house<BR>

The architectural style of the building can not be characterized uniquely: here you will find the Moorish style, and medieval Gothic, and a lot of all sorts of decorations of contrasting white color on the background of dark red bricks. And the interior decoration and arrangement were no less striking than the exterior. The floors were covered with mosaic tiles, and the railing of the wide grand staircase was richly decorated. The house had electricity and a telephone, hot water heating with a shower on each floor, and even a real lift<BR>
Alas, Vyatka did not attract St. Petersburg young lady even under the condition of a luxurious life, and in the end the merchant sold the mansion to the city authorities at a great loss for himself.</P>
